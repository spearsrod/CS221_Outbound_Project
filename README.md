# CS221_Outbound_Project

This repository holds the code I wrote to scrape data (data_collector.py for adventure data, collect_weather_reports.py for weather forecasts, pull_snow_reports.py for snowpack reports in the Sierra Nevadas, and msw_data_pull.py for surf and swell info). This data is stored in outbound_activity_info_forecasts.txt. The code for collecting training, validation, and test data for learning forecast weights is in save_training_samples.py this data is saved in test_data.txt, train_data.txt, and validate_data.txt. The code to train those weights is in train_forecast_weights.py and the weights were stored in final_weight_file.txt. The preprocessing of data for faster constrained optimization solving takes place in preprocessing.py and the output is stored in precomputed_data.txt. The CSP setup from the CS221 Course Scheduler is in the Course_CSP.py file. The code to set up the CSP as an optimization problem that fits my trip scheduler is in COP_setup.py The code to implement branch and bound and beam search along with modified code from the Backtraing Search from the Course Scheduler assignment is in COP_Solvers.py. Finally, the actual code to run the scheduler and generate plots for my paper is in efficient_cop_search.py.
